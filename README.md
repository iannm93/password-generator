## General info
this is a simple program designed using javascript and HTML, where on loading of the webpage, the user is prompted with various queries that will generate a random password string between 8 and 128 characters. The password string may include specials, uppers, lowers, and numbers. This is a great program to use if you're having trouble writing various passwords for all your online accounts. Just make sure you save them somewhere!
